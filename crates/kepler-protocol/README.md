# kepler-protocol

An implementation of [Kepler](https://github.com/kevinboone/kepler-protocol)
(`kepler://` on port 2009, `keplers://` on port 10009) in Rust.

Kepler is, in its author's words, "an incremental improvement over Gemini, as
Gemini is an incremental improvement over Gopher". The improvement is
**caching**, and it is the only cache model anywhere in the small-web family.

This is not the reference implementation, and it does not speak for the
protocol's author.

## What caching buys

- The request carries the epoch second of the copy you already hold, plus the
  languages you can read.
- A `2x` response declares the body's **length**, when it was **last updated**,
  and when it **expires**.
- A `7x` response says *nothing has changed*, and carries no body at all.

Two consequences worth knowing. A body's end is **declared rather than implied
by the connection closing**, unlike gemini and gopher, so a truncated transfer
is detectable. And encryption is **optional**: `kepler://` is plaintext,
`keplers://` is TLS, and which you get is the scheme's choice rather than the
protocol's.

## Layers

| Layer | Feature | Pulls |
|---|---|---|
| wire grammar | always on | nothing |
| client | `client` *(default)* | tokio, url |
| `keplers://` | `tls` | rustls |

```toml
kepler-protocol = { version = "0.1", default-features = false }  # grammar only
```

## Known gaps

**No server.** The client and the grammar are here; serving is additive and
simply has not been written.

**`keplers://` does not verify certificates.** That is stated rather than
hidden: kepler does not mandate encryption at all, so `keplers://` is best read
as "not in the clear" rather than "authenticated peer". Trust-on-first-use
pinning, as gemini has, is the obvious upgrade and is not implemented.
