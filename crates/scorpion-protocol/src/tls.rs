//! TLS for `scorpions://`.
//!
//! ## Why this module does not decide trust
//!
//! Scorpion's specification does not say how to validate a server
//! certificate. It says so outright: "There will be a separate document
//! written with further specifications about the handling of certificate
//! validation and of certificate chains", and elsewhere, of pinning, "the
//! specification for doing this is not written yet, and will be written
//! later."
//!
//! So this module carries the transport and leaves the policy to the caller.
//! Shipping a trust-on-first-use store here would be inventing a rule the
//! protocol has not made and presenting it as the protocol's, and a future
//! reader would have no way to tell the invention from the specification.
//! Gemini is a different case -- self-signed plus TOFU *is* its written
//! policy -- which is why `gemini-protocol` in this workspace does ship one.
//!
//! [`connect_with`] takes any `rustls` verifier, so a caller that already has
//! a pinning store, a CA bundle, or a policy of its own supplies it directly.
//! [`accept_any_verifier`] exists for callers that pin the certificate
//! themselves after the handshake, and is named to be hard to reach for by
//! accident.
//!
//! ## Two things the specification *does* require
//!
//! - **Session tickets are not reused.** They can be used for tracking, and
//!   the specification says clients "SHOULD NOT reuse tickets for multiple
//!   connections" (RFC 8446 §C.4). [`base_config`] disables resumption.
//! - **A client certificate over TLS 1.2 deserves a warning**, because client
//!   certificates are not encrypted before TLS 1.3. [`warn_on_client_cert`]
//!   reports whether a negotiated connection is in that position, so a caller
//!   can say so rather than leak an identity silently.
